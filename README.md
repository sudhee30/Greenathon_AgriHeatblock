**AgriHeatblocks**


This project focuses on the development of efficient AgriHeatblocks using agricultural residues. The goal is to convert waste products such as paddy straws, wheat straws, corn cobs, and ragi straws into high-calorific value briquettes, which can serve as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fuels. This approach aims to address both waste management issues and air pollution resulting from open-field burning of agricultural residues.

**Key Features**
Efficient Waste Utilization: Converts agricultural residues into valuable energy sources.
High Calorific Value: Briquettes with calorific values ranging from 15.2 to 17.5 MJ/kg.
Reduced Emissions: Produces less smoke compared to traditional fuels, contributing to cleaner air.
Economic Benefits: Provides farmers with a profitable alternative to burning agricultural waste.
**Project Goals**
Develop Biomass Briquettes: Create briquettes from agricultural residues and evaluate their properties.
Environmental Impact: Reduce air pollution and manage agricultural waste sustainably.
Economic Viability: Offer a profitable opportunity for farmers and improve energy efficiency.
**Technologies Used**
Material Processing: Shredding and drying systems for preparing agricultural residues.
Briquetting Machinery: Equipment for compressing residues into briquettes.
Quality Testing: Tools for assessing calorific value, ash content, and combustion properties.
Emission Monitoring: Systems to measure and analyze pollution levels during combustion.
**Usage**
For Cooking: Use briquettes as a fuel source for cooking, leveraging their high calorific value and reduced smoke production.
For Heating: Utilize briquettes in heating applications to replace traditional fuels.
**Results**
Performance Metrics: Briquettes achieved a maximum temperature of 335.4Â°C and a burn time of 11.18 minutes.
Comparison: One kilogram of paddy husk briquette equals 1.63 kilograms of wood fuel in terms of cooking efficiency.
